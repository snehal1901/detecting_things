# RECONGNIZING THINGS

In this notebook, I implement an object detection system utilizing pretrained YOLO weights and opencv primarily. 

The system, when run, allows for recognizing objects within images and videos. 
All that is needed is to provide the path of said input within the object_detection.ipynb notebook and execute it entirely.


## Libraries and Frameworks used:
* Numpy
* Opencv2
* YOLO weights (config) 

#### Python Version: 3.8.0
